# Parallel Programming
This is "2019 NTHU CS542200 Parallel Programming" course project.

## Homework1: Odd-Even Sort
Implement odd-even sort with MPI.

## Homework2: Mandelbrot Set
Parallelize the sequential Mandelbrot Set program by implementing the following two versions:

**1. pthread:** Single node shared memory programming using Pthread.

**2. hybrid:** Multi-node hybrid parallelism programming using MPI + OpenMP.

## Homework3: All-Pairs Shortest Path
Use threading to parallelize the all-pairs shortest path problem.

## Homework4-1: Blocked All-Pairs Shortest Path
Implement blocked Floyd-Warshall algorithm with cuda on single card.

## Homework4-2: Blocked All-Pairs Shortest Path (Multi-cards)
Implement blocked Floyd-Warshall algorithm with cuda on multi-cards.
